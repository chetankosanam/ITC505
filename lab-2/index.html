<h1>FL-XGBTC: Federated Learning Inspired with XGBoost Tuned Classifier for YouTube Spam Content Detection</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The problem of spam content in YouTube comments
    is an ongoing issue, and detecting such content is a
    critical task to maintain the quality of user experience on
    the platform. In this study, we propose a Federated Learning
    Inspired XG-Boost Tuned Classifier, FL-XGBTC, for
    YouTube spam content detection. The proposed model leverages
    the advantages of federated learning, which enables the
    training of a model collaboratively across multiple devices
    without sharing raw data. The FL-XGBTC model is based
    on the XGBoost algorithm, which is a powerful and widely
    used ensemble learning algorithm for classification tasks.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Because it was so popular, spammers utilized YouTube’s
    comments section as a means of spreading their spam. This
    has raised concerns since spam can result in phishing attacks
    that target anybody who clicks on a bad link. The characteristics
    of spam may be evaluated and identified by using
    classification. The detection of YouTube spam might use
    some improvements. A five-stage framework for identifying
    YouTube spam was built (Abdulhamid et al. 2017) to carry
    out the tests, including data collection, pre-processing, feature
    selection, extraction, classification, and detection. Two
    distinct kinds of data were examined to analyze and validate
    the YouTube detection methods proposed in this work. You-
    Tube is a video-sharing website that was founded in 2005.
    Google purchased YouTube in 2006 and it is now part of
    Google Subsidiaries (Abu Al-Haija et al. 2022). Sending
    unwanted messages using a messaging network is known
    as spamming. Concerning information, YouTube is one of
    the most popular websites. The ability for viewers to follow
    channels, comment on particular videos, and subscribe to
    channels is YouTube’s finest feature.</p>

<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>better when evaluated and contrasted with other data mining
    methods. To be more specific, our classifier highlights
    the hazards to young viewers by finding inappropriate content
    targeting toddlers on YouTube with an accuracy rate of
    84.3%. Next, we carry out a quantitative large-scale characterization
    to highlight the risks associated with toddlers
    coming across harmful information while they are innocently
    navigating the platform. These results highlight the
    problem of problematic films on YouTube, which persists,
    and the shortcomings of existing systems to detect them
    quickly. Using the grid-search cross-validation approach
    to create ensemble models, he improved them by looking
    for the optimal hyperparameter values. The two algorithms’
    baseline (untuned) and tuned performance models are analyzed
    and compared. Also, the effects of hyperparameter
    changing on both models were looked at (Gothankar et al.
    2021; Gourisaria et al. 2022; Khan et al. 2022; Kumar and
    Sachdeva 2022).</p>

<h2>Mathematical Modeling of Proposed Approach</h2>
<p>function relations, and they impart a significant role in
    the mathematical implementation. In federated learning,
    there are 1000 total iterations. Each client node creates a
    special local model using a special local dataset and trains
    it throughout five local rounds. Each local model makes
    some progress in its unique way. After each loop, a copy
    of the shared model is delivered to each of the 4 youtube
    users.
    Last but not least, calculations are performed to keep
    track of the local losses and local accuracies and to graph
    them. This common model—the averaged model is sent to
    all 4 institutions at the start of each cycle (Concone et al.
    2022; Ezpeleta et al. 2018).</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>different YouTube videos. The spam classification investigation
    dataset was made publicly available by Alberto, Lochter,
    and Almeida (2015) 15. Thank you so much for doing it. The
    YouTube API was used to gather comments on five of the
    top ten videos with the most views in the first half of 2015.
    All five of the tunes are video songs. The Korean musician
    Psy’s "Gangnam Style" is one of them. The other performances
    included Katy Perry, LMFAO, Eminem, Shakira,
    and LMFAO. Try answering a few of the remarks. The comments
    were manually tagged as either legitimate or spam.
    One comment was spam, while there were none from real
    people (https:// www. kaggle. com/ datas ets/ laksh mi25n pathi/
    images).</p>

<h2>Training and Testing Process</h2>
<p>We applied TF-IDF for vectorized comments in the numerical
    vector. After that, we split the data into training and
    testing datasets. We took testing dataset 20% ratio and the
    training dataset 80% ratio. After that, we apply differentdifferent
    machine learning algorithms to find good accuracy
    and precision score. In Table 3, In the assessment of fourdifferent models, machine learning techniques were evaluated
    on a binary classification problem. With 94% accuracy
    and 95% precision, the Random Forest performed admirably.
    A 91% accuracy and 97% precision were noted for the Decision
    Tree, indicating that it is quite good at finding positive
    examples. Its capacity to correctly categorise positive cases
    is shown by the 91% accuracy and 96% precision shown
    using logistic regression. With a precision score of 93%.</p>

<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
<p>ham merely based on its content while remaining resistant
    to modifications is still needed Fig. 5 Due to the imprecise
    nature of English, this proves to be an arduous computer
    task. The recent rise in processing capacity has made it possible
    to use Machine learning approaches to handle such
    challenges. Our contribution in this direction is to find algorithms
    that can reliably detect spam with a high F1 Score
    and increase the classifier’s performance.
    Objectives:
    Step1:clean the data.
    Step2:perform exploratory data analysis
    Step3: performance analysis of the different-different
    machine learning model.
    Now it’s time to Implement our theoretical idea in practical
    things; for that, we followed the steps below.
    • Data Mining
    • Exploratory Data Analysis
    • Text Preprocessing
    • Model Building
    • Evaluation
    • Improvement
    • Deploy the model</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The relevance of the proposed federated learning framework
    is emphasised in the study’s conclusion, "FL-XGBTC:
    Federated Learning Inspired with XG-Boost Tuned Classifier
    for YouTube Spam Content Detection". Significant
    improvements in YouTube spam content identification are
    demonstrated by the incorporation of XG-Boost as a classifier,
    optimised for maximum performance. With the use of
    a federated learning technique, the study effectively tackles
    the difficulties associated with spam identification in the
    dynamic YouTube environment, promoting cooperative
    learning across decentralised devices and protecting user
    privacy.In order to provide resilience against spam material,
    the XG-Boost classifier is fine-tuned even more to improve
    accuracy and precision. Based on its capacity to respond
    to the diverse and dynamic nature of YouTube spam, the
    results demonstrate the superiority of the federated learninginspired
    model over conventional centralised techniques.</p>
